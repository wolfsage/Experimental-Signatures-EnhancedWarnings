Experimental-Signatures-EnhancedWarnings version 0.01
=====================================================

Experimental::Signatures::EnhancedWarnings - Make Perl 5.20 signature warnings more useful


SYNOPSIS
--------

  use feature qw(signatures);
  no warnings 'experimental::signatures';
  use Experimental::Signatures::EnhancedWarnings;

  # Proceed as normal...


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Currently, warnings from subs with signatures show incorrect file/line numbers
(the file/line where the sub was defined, NOT where it was called from.) This
module attempts to remedy that by injecting itself into calls to Perl_pp_die(),
and checking for one of the three errors that signatures may throw:

    * Too few arguments for subroutine

    * Too many arguments for subroutine

    * Odd name/value argument for subroutine


WARNING: This means that if you manually call "die()" with any of the three warnings
above, your errors may report incorrect information.


SEE ALSO
--------

See "perldoc perlsub", subsection "signatures" for more information about signatures.
